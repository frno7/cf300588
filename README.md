# CF300588 shifter

The CF300588 module in C is designed to be compatible with the
GST shifter C300588-001 made by Atari in 1988. This device was used in the
[Atari STE] computer in 1989.

The CF300588 repository is made to be included as a Git submodule in larger
designs, for example [PSG play](https://github.com/frno7/psgplay).
